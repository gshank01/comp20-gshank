My garfield site works within the expectations of the assignment.

I spent at least four hours on this assignment trying to figure out the X and Y axes for the garfield image. Discussed the axis with Nathalie, though we only have a working understanding of it now.

Thank you for writing this assignment! It was a good problem to work through.
