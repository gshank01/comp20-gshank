This is the README file for Assignment 2, landmarks.

Everything works, to the best of my knowledge, though I decided to show all landmarks instead of only within one mile. If I wanted to only show them within one mile I would make an if statement for the distance in miles and put my marker-making functions inside of it.


sources cited by line, except that the icons were taken from: http://www.benjaminkeen.com/google-maps-coloured-markers/

Lastly, I have only just realized that I should include the project name in my commit messages. I will be doing this for all future assignments!
