This is the README file for Assignment 2, landmarks.



Right now my page will load the map, take my location, and do the XMLHttp request to get the data of other students. While I feel that I learned a lot about these main topics, I did not make it to successfully putting my marker or those of other students on the map. In an attempt to outline my thought process and future moves I wrote out in comments how I had planned to set up specifically the markers of student users (similar idea for landmarks).

I spent about 12 hours on this assignment up to now.
