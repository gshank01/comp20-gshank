My readme file!

What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)
	The purpose of this Git repository was to be able to keep my projects
	and assignments safe and to share them, plus prior editions of them, 
	with you.

What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
	My favorite assignment was the portfolio. I feel like I can keep adding
	to it for a long time and make it useful to me despite my lack of 
	a computer science major.

How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
	I have learned a lot about the internet and FORMATTING. Formatting has
	been the bane of my comp-20 existence. That said, other concepts have 
	been great to learn in this class BECAUSE I LEARNED TO LOOK SHIT UP
	(or to go to a TA with a formed question).

What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
	How to google a problem. I had to learn to use Stack overflow and to rely 
	heavily on the API manuals in order to complete the landmarks and semester
	projects specifically.

Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
	I want to learn more front-end stuff. I am going to take a web course
	at the SMFA next semester so that I can do my own independent projects
	and be taught how to do the design aspect of the sites.
